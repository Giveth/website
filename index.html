IMPORTANT: When building site with Jekyll, use this command (use bash on windows):
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build

Please let's have a culture of attribution, especially with pictures.

The way I do it:

1 - Use title attribute to display CC info on mouse_hover, example:
		title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"

2 - Link to original image with attribute target="blank", full example:
 		<a href="https://flic.kr/p/Rd94j6" target="blank"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Bridges not Walls" title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"/></a>

    <h2>TRANSPARENT DONATION FLOW WITH ETHEREUM</h2>
    <p>
      Giveth is a completely free and open source platform, that will enable
      people to build communities around causes. Our Donation Application (Dapp)
      empowers Givers and Makers to work together toward achieving a common goal.

      Campaigns raising funds with Giveth can be trusted because of a mix of
      blockchain based transparency and social accountability.

      Causes that will make the world a better a place will run on the Ethereum
      blockchain to enable high level security and transparent accounting, so you
      can donate to your favorite cause, know **exactly** where your donation went,
      what it **accomplished** and most important: Know the **details** of the whole process!

    <h2>Creating Altruistic Communities</h2>
    <p><quote>
        "Anyone can create a cause on anything they feel strongly about supporting.
        Whether it is solar energy to impoverished    area, or organizing a recycling campaign, they can use the Giveth platform
        to find other people that share their excitement.  Giveth encourage organized efforts
        and shared resources to tackle global and local problems together. The main goal is to cultivate connections
        that build strong communities upon a solid foundation of transparency and accountabilitypowered by blockchain tech."

<div id="section3" class="container-fluid">
    <h2>Connecting and Rewarding</h2>
    <p>"Every donation is an opportunity
        to build a connection between like minded individuals, all those who are making it happen.

        Giveth uses smart contracts
        on the E T H E R E U M blockchain
        to create a transparent donation flow
        that keeps Givers in control
        of their contributions
        until it is locked in
        to be used for a specific purpose
        and once paid out
        the details of what their donation did
        is permanently recorded on the blockchain.

        These smart contracts also allow 'Givers' to trust
        that their donations will be spent effectively
        as 'Makers' are rewarded on a milestone basis."

      <h2>Transparent Innovation</h2>
    </div>
    <div class ="row d-flex">
      <p>"Giveth will revolutionize donation giving
        by fusing smart contract governance systems,
        and peer to peer community building
        on social media platforms.

        It can be used by NGOs to automate accounting, collect and distribute donated funds,
        provide oversight to projects on a global scale, minimizing intermediaries across the board.

        The Dapp is designed to be modular and flexible to allow for permissionless innovation.
        With Giveth, unique solutions can be implemented to address common problems,
        like building incentive structures for independent reviewers to verify the completion of milestones,
        or Rewarding Volunteers with tokens, badges or even ether
        to keep them engaged with the Cause and the Community."

                <h4>Minime</h4>
                <p>The MiniMe token makes it trivial for ANYONE to upgrade a Dapp/DAO
                  midstream to include new features in a decentralized fashion, without
                  having to migrate to a new token contract and without having to ask for
                  permission.

                <p>The Vault Contract is designed to hold ether and safely automate payments
                   in a Dapp/DAO environment. It allows for a step-by-step decentralization
                   process as trust in the code base is built over time.

                <h4>Delegated Governance</h4>
                <p>One of Giveth core contracts we are working on enables a donor to
                  delegate authority over their donations in a simple gas efficient way,
                  following the principles of liquid democracy.

                <h4>Milestone Payouts</h4>
                <p>Our milestone contracts once fully tested and they are able to keep
                  organizations and causes accountable to their supporters. Breaking down
                  lump sum amounts and ensuring milestones completion is an approach that
                  would help all types of organizations (for profit or non-profits) as well
                  as the current ICO ecosystem by reassuring that contributed funds are
                  well spent.
