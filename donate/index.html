Contributions are actively encouraged!

IMPORTANT: When building site with Jekyll, use this command (use bash on windows):
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build

Please let's have a culture of attribution, especially with pictures.

The way I do it:

1 - Use title attribute to display CC info on mouse_hover, example:
		title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"

2 - Link to original image with attribute target="blank", full example:
 		<a href="https://flic.kr/p/Rd94j6" target="blank"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Bridges not Walls" title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"/></a>

        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>
          We are the Community building the Giveth Donation Application, <a href="https://giveth.io">the platform</a>. Our system will make it possible for nonprofits and individuals to unite and make the world a better place, by enabling full transparency and accountability towards Givers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are the primordial Decentralized Altruistic Community (DAC), we are the Giveth Unicorns, the first users of our own platform and as every DAC, we need Givers to support us. You could be this Giver.
        </p>
        <h3>Why donate to Giveth?</h3>
        <p>
          As opposed to traditional charity, with Giveth every donation and pledge is transparent, so you always know <strong>exactly</strong> where your donation went and get a good sense of the impact it made in direct communication with your beneficiary.

    <ul class="flex-row d-flex features">

            Decentralized Altruistic Community</a>
          and is not a registered as a charitable entity, we are however registered on the blockchain ;-) We are a community-led project and will not derive any direct profit from the platform. We strive to
          <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/about/">model the DAC concept </a>
          as one of the first not-for-profit blockchain based entities. We guarantee all funds will get recycled back into the Community that is ensuring the Giveth Platform gets adopted widely.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>What is the roadmap for the Giveth Platform? </h5>
        <p>
          The roadmap for the Giveth DApp can be found <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/documentation/product-roadmap/">here</a>.
          <br>

        <h5>How do the Giveth Governance Tokens work and how do I get these? </h5>
