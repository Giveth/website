<!-- DonateToGiveth website maintained by @geleeroyale
Contributions are actively encouraged!

IMPORTANT: When building site with Jekyll, use this command (use bash on windows):
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build

Please let's have a culture of attribution, especially with pictures.

The way I do it:

1 - Use title attribute to display CC info on mouse_hover, example:
		title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"

2 - Link to original image with attribute target="blank", full example:
 		<a href="https://flic.kr/p/Rd94j6" target="blank"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Bridges not Walls" title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"/></a>

          There are some things we would like you to know, before you continue:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1 - For every <strong>1 ETH</strong> you donate you will get <strong>1 Giveth governance token</strong> (usable for governance in future versions)
            </li>
            <li>
              2 - In order to receive your token, please only donate from an ERC-20 compliant wallet, like Metamask or myetherwallet
            </li>
            <li>
              3 - Our transaction address
            </li>
            <li>
              4 - We can accept direct transactions in ETH only. If you want to donate with another cryptocurrency or token, please use shapeshift to exchange them into ETH. Please note: If you transfer directly through shapeshift, you will miss out on your governance token!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br><br>
          To make it easy for you to donate, we use a pre-filled form on myetherwallet, accessible with this button here:
          <a class="btn btn-secondary" href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/?to=0x5ADF43DD006c6C36506e2b2DFA352E60002d22Dc&gaslimit=23000&data=3C33#send-transaction">Donate to Giveth!</a>
