Contributions are actively encouraged!

IMPORTANT: When building site with Jekyll, use this command (use bash on windows):
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build

Please let's have a culture of attribution, especially with pictures.

The way I do it:

1 - Use title attribute to display CC info on mouse_hover, example:
		title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"

2 - Link to original image with attribute target="blank", full example:
 		<a href="https://flic.kr/p/Rd94j6" target="blank"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Bridges not Walls" title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"/></a>

          Giveth is a Decentralized Altruistic Community, meaning we depend on generous Givers ourselves. If you want to help us build the Future of Giving by contributing any amount, big or small, please contact @griffgreen on Riot or donate directly to the ethereum address 'revolution.eth' which resolves to: <span class="word-wrap">0x5ADF43DD006c6C36506e2b2DFA352E60002d22Dc</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          We take any erc20 tokens, but if you donate eth and send it from MEW, Metamask, Mist or Parity you'll receive Giveth tokens in return! Giveth tokens will one day be part of our decentralized governance system - talk to us in Riot for any questions on this.
        </p>
          <h5>You get a Giveth token for your donation!</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1 - For every <strong>1 ETH</strong> you donate you will get <strong>1 Giveth governance token</strong> (usable for governance in future versions)
            </li>
            <li>
              2 - In order to receive your token, please only donate from an ERC-20 compliant wallet, like Metamask or myetherwallet
            </li>
            <li>
              3 - Our transaction address
            </li>
            <li>
              4 - We can accept direct transactions in ETH only. If you want to donate with another cryptocurrency or token, please use shapeshift to exchange them into ETH. Please note: If you transfer directly through shapeshift, you will miss out on your governance token!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>The easiest way to donate ETH is via myetherwallet</strong>, accessible with this button here:
